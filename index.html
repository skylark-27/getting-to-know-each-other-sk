		<div id="content"><h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Hello, my name is Skylar Koczor, and I am currently a sophomore here at Lewis University. 
		   I do not currently have a major, though I am deciding between either computer science or psychology. 
		   By the end of this semester, I plan on declaring my major, whatever it may end up being. I grew up in Frankfort, IL 
		   and graduated from Lincoln-Way East High School. I did gymnastics for most of my life, and it was my 
		   favorite sport that I participated in. My best event was vault, but I also enjoyed doing floor. 
		   I have also dabbled in graphic design and photography, but I have not taken those hobbies up recently. 
		   My family owns a boat, and we keep it in on Lake Michigan in a marina up in Wisconsin during the summer. 
		   I have my boating license, so I always enjoy using our WaveRunner when we go to Wisconsin and both the weather 
		   and water is nice. Additionally, I enjoy comic related media like the MCU, and I have just started to gain an interest in DC.
		   Hopefully, I will eventually get into comics, as I have been meaning to, but I just have the dedicate
		   the time to do so. My family consists of my mom, dad, and myself. I also have a dog whose name is Ginger, 
		   and she is a <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/keeshond/pictures/" target="_blank">keeshond</a>. It is always great to hang out with her, except for when I try to walk her because
		   she is not fond of them and can become quite stubborn. It is actually hilarious how my dog sometimes acts on walks, 
		   but it is annoying when it is happening. My mom works at my town's park district, so I have often
		   aided her programs and some community events that are hosted there as I grew up. My dad and I like to bond by going to the 
		   theater together, mostly for Marvel movies but any movie that catches our interest is ideal. 
		   He has also attempted to teach me how to cook since he is the family's resident chef, but I do not have
		   the same knack for it as he does. Cooking together is fun though, even if it is not my specialty.</p>

		<h3>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Different programming languages</li>
			<li>The basics of web development</li>
			<li>Information on artificial intelligence</li>
			<li>Understanding the number systems computers use</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>My Favorite Hobby/Activity</h3>
		<p>My favorite hobby is kind of two hobbies that go hand in hand: reading and writing. Around middle school, 
		   I was an avid reader. I was finishing books left and right. I have since fallen out of that habit, but I 
		   still love to read. It just now consists mostly of fan written stories for various sources of media that I am 
		   captivated by. In a way, it is kind of weird to consider this a hobby and definitely not one I talk about often, 
		   but it is a favorite way of mine to spend some of my free time. With that also comes writing. I always tend to 
		   view the two hobbies as a packaged deal. When you get into one, you tend to become interested in the other as well. 
		   Every once and a while, I write down stories, or at least the start of one, when I have a spark of creativity. 
		   It is a nice outlet to get those thoughts out of my brain into something that makes me feel productive. Small 
		   little stories are always flowing through my mind, so I might as well put them to good use. I do not tend to 
		   write that often, but it is always a fun, if sometimes frustrating, process.</p>

		<h3>Fun Fact</h3>
		<p>I can technically say that I have been boating my entire life because the first time I went boating, I was only a week old.</p>
